# Kyria Configs

I injured my wrist long time ago. But recently the pain is coming back. To reduce pain I have started using a Kyria mechanical keyboard. This keyboard is a 50% keyboard with ortholinear keys. And it looks like this.

I am not fancy enough to try different keyboard layouts. I want to be able to switch to normal keyboard and able to type for this reason I am sticking with QWERTY layout.
